# GameColorTheMatrix
This is a project consisting of a game in which the entire array must be colored a specific color to win the game. In more detail, with your first click you choose the color, with the second click you color the section with the chosen color in the first step. Then the entire section of the same color will be colored with the first color. Once you have colored the entire matrix with the purple color you will win, and if you color in any other color you will lose. The matrix is generated randomly. The game also included the possibility to increase or decrease the size of the matrix and increase and decrease the number of colors used.
This game also included the ability to save the current game and load the last saved game. This meant that it included writing and reading files.
